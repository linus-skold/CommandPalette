# `>` Command Palette

Command Palette gives you everything at your fingertips with a single search. Use `CTRL+SHIFT+P` to bring up the Command Palette and search for what you are looking for. Use `UP` + `DOWN` arrow keys to adjust your selection, and click `ENTER` to execute, or simply click on the option with your mouse.

## 🫥 Missing Something?

If you are finding something missing from Command Palette:

### Players 🧍

Make a [New Issue](https://github.com/MichaelPriebe/CommandPalette/issues) with your requested action.

### Localizers 🌐

See [Localization on CurseForge](https://legacy.curseforge.com/wow/addons/command-palette/localization).

### Addon Developers 🧑‍💻

Consider making Bindings for your addons features. Command Palette adds all game and addon bindings to the interface. This helps your users regardless of them using Command Palette.

Binding icons are automatically set to your addons `IconTexture` if your addon name matches the header or category text. Per-binding icons can be set with a global variable:

```lua
-- Any first argument to TextureBase:SetTexture
BINDING_ICON_RAIDTARGET1 = 137001
```

If there is an action that does not fit as a binding, you can register a new module to add your actions. Example: [Titles.lua](CommandPalette/modules/Titles.lua)

### Blizzard ❄️

- [ ] Create more Bindings for game functions.
  - Also fix the disappearance of keybind headers.
- [ ] Create a `binding` type for `SecureActionButtonTemplate`.
  - Player created bindings should obviously not run secure code, but Blizzard bindings should.
- [ ] Allow `spellIndex` and `bookType` for `spell` action for `SecureActionButtonTemplate`.
  - Mainly for pet actions that arent spells. So they arent required to be on your pets action bar.
  - Would use `CastSpell` instead of `CastSpellByID` and `CastSpellByName`
- [ ] Create `nearbyX` unit types.
  - Nameplates dont work with NPC's.
  - Nameplates dont work with > 40 units.
- [ ] Bring back `[target=Name]` or `[@Name]` macro conditionals, and make functions that take `UnitID`/`UnitToken` also take a name.
  - You can already work around this using a macro. But macro's will change the users target and target history.
